"It is common to find problems with graphs that have not been constructed "
"fully noded or in graphs with z-levels at intersection that have been "
"entered incorrectly. An other problem is one way streets that have been "
"entered in the wrong direction. We can not detect errors with respect to "
"\"ground\" truth, but we can look for inconsistencies and some anomalies in "
"a graph and report them for additional inspections."
