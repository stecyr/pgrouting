"Typically when GIS files are loaded into the data database for use with "
"pgRouting they do not have topology information associated with them. To "
"create a useful topology the data needs to be \"noded\". This means that "
"where two or more roads form an intersection there it needs to be a node at "
"the intersection and all the road segments need to be broken at the "
"intersection, assuming that you can navigate from any of these segments to "
"any other segment via that intersection."

"You can use the :ref:`graph analysis functions <analytics>` to help you see "
"where you might have topology problems in your data. If you need to node "
"your data, we also have a function :ref:`pgr_nodeNetwork() "
"<pgr_node_network>` that might work for you. This function splits ALL "
"crossing segments and nodes them. There are some cases where this might NOT "
"be the right thing to do."

"For example, when you have an overpass and underpass intersection, you do "
"not want these noded, but pgr_nodeNetwork does not know that is the case and"
" will node them which is not good because then the router will be able to "
"turn off the overpass onto the underpass like it was a flat 2D intersection."
" To deal with this problem some data sets use z-levels at these types of "
"intersections and other data might not node these intersection which would "
"be ok."

"For those cases where topology needs to be added the following functions may"
" be useful. One way to prep the data for pgRouting is to add the following "
"columns to your table and then populate them as appropriate. This example "
"makes a lot of assumption like that you original data tables already has "
"certain columns in it like ``one_way``, ``fcc``, and possibly others and "
"that they contain specific data values. This is only to give you an idea of "
"what you can do with your data."

"The function :ref:`pgr_createTopology() <pgr_create_topology>` will create "

"example, the ``fcc`` column contains feature class code and the ``CASE`` "
"statements converts it to an average speed."
