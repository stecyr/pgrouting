"pgRouting 2.0 release has total restructured the function naming and "
"obsoleted many of the functions that were available in the 1.x releases. "
"While we realize that this may inconvenience our existing users, we felt "
"this was needed for the long term viability of the project to be more "
"response to our users and to be able to add new functionality and test "
"existing functionality."

"We have made a minimal effort to save most of these function and distribute "
"with the release in a file ``pgrouting_legacy.sql`` that is not part of the "
"pgrouting extension and is not supported. If you can use these functions "
"that is great. We have not tested any of these functions so if you find "
"issues and want to post a pull request or a patch to help other users that "
"is fine, but it is likely this file will be removed in a future release and "
"we strongly recommend that you convert your existing code to use the new "
"documented and supported functions."
